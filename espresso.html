<h2> terms: </h2>

 
Extraction: the process of dissolving ground coffees with hot water
<br>
Crema:a flavorful, aromatic, reddish-brown froth that rests on top of a shot of espresso, formed when air bubbles combine with fine-ground coffee's soluble oils
<br>
Portafilter: holds the basket to the group head during extraction.
<br>
Steam wand: the part of the machine that you steam milk with, also known as a steam pipe, activated by the steam valve and steam valve knob or lever

Burr grinder: shave the coffee bean into precise microscopic flakes

<h5> step by step: </h5>

<p> 1. In order to get the best out of your espresso maker, you’ll need to ensure that the entire machine is preheated. This can take up to 25 minutes for some machines, so get your machine warming up in advance!

PRO TIP – If you want to speed this process you can pull a blank shot by simply omitting the espresso from the porta-filter. Pulling this shot straight into your espresso cup does double duty, preheating it as well. </p>
<p> 2. Set your grinder to a fine grind size, don’t worry too much about what “perfect” looks like right now, we’ll come back to this.

Place your portafilter on your scale and tare the scale out, then fill your portafilter with around 20 grams of ground coffee. It is a good idea to write down how much you used so that you can remain consistent during the dialing in phase.

Your machine’s portafilter has a capacity recommended by the manufacturer. It is prudent to work within the range they’ve provided as some portafilters are larger or smaller than others!

If you’re lucky enough to have an espresso machine with a built-in grinder, simply grind into your portafilter. Ideally you’ll have a little mountain of ground coffee in your portafilter basket. Use your hand to shave away the excess coffee, push it into the nooks and crannies and smooth it down so you can start applying pressure with your tamper (next step). </p>
<p> 3. Tamp Your Grounds So The Bed Is Flat And Even
You’ll want your beans roughly evenly distributed before tamping. This can be accomplished by lightly tapping the side of the portafilter with your hand, or even by leveling the espresso grounds off with the side of your finger as we showed you above.

Once you’ve done that it’s time to get tamping. The key to tamping well is to press down straight – you do not want to have an uneven puck. You’ll want to use a fair bit of pressure her, although the age-old wisdom of 30lbs of pressure is probably overkill. A good rule to follow is tamp until the grounds stop settling, always ensuring that you have a level top. Give your tamper a quick spin to polish the top of your espresso puck. Brush off any excess grounds clinging to the top or side of your portafilter and you’re ready to get brewing! PRO TIP – You Tamping is a bit of an art and you get better at it with practice. Get a journal/notepad and note down the type of bean you’re using, and an idea of how much you tamped (e.g. “Pushed down at roughly 50% strength until grounds stopped compressing”). This will be invaluable later when dialing in the shot.</p>
<p> 4. Pull Your First Shot
While you pull this shot, time how long it takes to hit 2 ounces (the typical size of a double shot). Ideally, you’ll end up between 20 and 30 seconds per pull.

If you’re in this range then technically are done, you’ve made espresso. Hopefully it is rich and dark and sweet and glorious. But, the reality is that this first shot is just establishing a baseline.</p>
<p> 5. Dial In The Shot
If you’re using a machine with a pressure gauge take note of the pressure reached. This will help you in adjusting your next shot if you have too much or little pressure. Good espresso machines (like these) will give you an indicator of how well (or poorly) extracted your shot is.If you don’t have a gauge; taste your espresso and make your mind up. Note it down in your journal. If your espresso pulled too quickly you’ll want to change to a finer grind. Conversely, if your espresso took an eternity to pull you’ll want a coarser grind. 

When you change the grind size you’ll want to toss the first portafilter worth of grounds. The grounds right after you change the setting will consist of a mix of sizes.

Ultimately we don’t measure flavor in seconds. If your espresso tastes under-extracted (sour) then you’ll want a finer grind. Bitterness indicates that your espresso is over-extracted and you should select a coarser grind.

If you switch between roasts, particularly between light and dark, you’ll have to repeat this dialing in process. Darker roasts are easier to over-extract than light roasts and typically benefit from a coarser grind. Don’t forget to dispose your grounds properly, or better yet use a good knock box for them.

At this stage you decide whether you want to enjoy the espresso pure, like an Italian, or turn it into a milk based coffee. If the latter is the case, keep reading, it’s time to work on the milk.</p>
<p> 6. Steam Your Milk
Hopefully your machine has a steam wand built in. If not, you’ll have to use a separate milk steamer to steam your milk.Using your machines steam wand – Start out with cold milk poured into your stainless steel milk pitcher. Turn on your steamer wand briefly to eliminate any condensation that may have accumulated in the wand.

Next, put the steamer wand tip below the surface of the milk. Turn on your steamer and froth the milk until it reaches your desired consistency. Be sure to keep the steamer wand just below the surface during this process.

Once you’ve reached the frothiness you want, plunge the tip to the bottom of your milk vessel and continue steaming until you reach your desired temperature. Wipe your wand down and give it a brief purge to keep things sanitary. At the recommended temperature of 55–65°C (139–149°F), all of the fats in milk have melted into liquid form and will not destroy the foam.

The key to foaming your milk is heat. Too little and your foam won’t stay together, too much and your milk will taste burnt and unpleasant. Practice practice practice and you’ll get a feel for it.
