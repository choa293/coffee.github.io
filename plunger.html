<h5> step by step: </h5>

<p> 1. Bring water to a boil, remove from heat and allow to cool to about 200ºF (about 30 seconds after the water comes to a full boil).</p>
<p> 2. Add the ground coffee to the carafe and then the hot water. After one minute, you’ll notice the coffee grounds float up to the top and create what is called a “crust.” Use a wooden spoon to gently break through the crust and stir. The grounds will sink to the bottom. </p>
<p> 3. Place the lid on the carafe with the plunger pulled all the way up and steep for three more minutes. </p>
<p> 4. Gently push the plunger all the way down after three minutes and serve immediately; the coffee will continue to brew and become bitter as it sits </p>
<p> 5. Enjoy!</p>
<p> 6. Clean your French press after each use. </p>
