<h5> step by step: </h5>

<p> 1. Preheat the water. Bring kettle water to a boil and remove from heat. We do this to keep the temperature of the moka pot from getting too hot and cooking the coffee, imparting a metallic taste.</p>
<p> 2. Grind your coffee on a drip coffee setting, about as fine as table salt. You need enough coffee to fill the filter basket, which is about 15 to 17 grams (or about 2.5 Tablespoons) for a 4-cup Bialetti moka pot. </p>
<p> 3. Add the heated water and fill to the line in the bottom of the brewer. </p>
<p> 4. Insert the filter basket into the brewer bottom. </p>
<p> 5. Fill the basket with coffee, slightly mounded, and level the surface off with your finger. Brush away loose grounds on the top edge of the filter basket.</p>
<p> 6. Screw the top and bottom together. Use hot pads and donâ€™t over tighten.</p>
<p> 7. Put the brewer on the stove, use moderate heat and make sure that the handle is not subjected to heat. Leave the top lid open.</p>
<p> 8. The coffee will begin to come out and you will hear a puffing sound and see a rich-brown stream that will get progressively lighter in color. Once the stream is the color of yellow honey, remove from heat source with hot pads and close the lid.</p>
<p> 9. Wrap the bottom of the pot in a chilled bar towel or run under cold tap water to stop extraction. We do this to prevent the coffee from developing a metallic taste. The idea here is to get a relatively small amount of coffee which is very concentrated and rich. </p>
<p> 10. As soon as the coffee stops bubbling out, pour it into cups or a carafe. You may wish to dilute with hot water depending on preference. Good luck! </p>
