 <h4>a pourover</h4>
 
  <h4>grinder</h4>

  <h4>filters:</h4>
  <p>Paper filters are single-use and do a great job keeping fine sediment out of your coffee but do absorb some of the flavorful oils.
Stainless steel filters are multi-use and won’t soak up any oils but frequently allow finer sediment into your cup.
Cloth filters are hybrids of paper and stainless steel. They are multi-use and strain out fine sediment but require a lot more maintenance (they shouldn’t dry out).</p>

<h5> step by step: </h5>

<p> 1. Grind your coffee. Allow me to repeat: The grind is the most important part of your coffee. </p>
<p> 2.Measure out your grounds and water. A good rule of thumb is 6 oz of water for every 2 tablespoons (10 grams) of ground coffee, and different grinds (e.g. medium-fine or medium) will have different optimal ratios. Find what works for you.</p>
<p> 3. Heat your water. No single temperature is best for every cup of coffee. In general 195°F-205°F is the optimal range, but that’s not a hard-and-fast rule. Aerobie, the makers of the Aeropress, recommend using 175°F water! For pour over coffee, though, you’ll probably want water as hot-off-the-boil as possible. This is because there’s no “open spout” lever that controls how long the water is trapped with the ground coffee. Instead, the water can fall through into the mug or collecting vessel on its own. Therefore, the hotter water speeds up dissolution and ensures a properly extracted cup.</p>
<p> 4. Wet your grounds. The first contact between coffee grounds and water is appropriately called “wetting.” You may also hear it referred to as “blooming” because the dry coffee grounds absorb the first water they come into contact with and expand like a rising dough. In this step you’re slowly pouring enough water into the ground coffee only to the point where it’s been completely absorbed by the grounds. This is where the hot water works its magic, extracting the desired caffeine and organic compounds, plus some of the less desired bitter compounds. The goal is to find the proper combination of grind size, water temperature and contact time to yield the best blend of extracted compounds for flavor and mouthfeel. How long should this step last? It varies, but start with 30 seconds and adjust from there. After the 30 seconds has passed, it’s time to finish your cup.</p>
<p> 5. Continue pouring. Rate of pouring is one of the most important factors in manual drip brewing and is what really separates this process from other methods of brewing. There are 2 main approaches with infinite variations in the middle: Approach 1: Slowly and continuously pour hot water to maintain only the thinnest layer of water on top of the grounds Approach 2: Rapidly pour hot water to the top of the coffee maker and let it drip through at its own rate, occasionally topping off. I prefer Approach 1. A lot of people will do some kind of hybrid approach where they continuously pour but allow the water level in the grounds to slowly rise (rate of pouring slightly exceeds rate of output). Again, see what works for you! </p>
<p> 6. Experiment is the operative word here. Test each variable one at a time.

For example, keep everything constant but change your rate of pouring. Did you observe different results? Was your coffee better or worse? Lock in that variable and then try different water temperatures. Then modify your grind size. And all the while feel free to keep going back to previous variables and modify those one by one, too.

If you’re really dedicated to crafting that perfect cup, keep a log of your different recipes and describe how they turned out, what you liked and what you didn’t like. </p>
